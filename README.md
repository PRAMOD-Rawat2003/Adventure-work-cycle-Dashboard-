Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive and comprehensive sales performance dashboard for Adventure Works Cycles using Power BI. The dashboard provides actionable business insights by leveraging a structured approach that includes Data Extraction, Transformation, Loading (ETL), Data Modeling, and Visualization.

Process Summary
Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)
Data Extraction: Collected raw data from various sources including sales databases, customer records, and inventory systems.

Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed the data by handling missing values, normalizing formats, and calculating key metrics (total quantity sold, return quantity, total revenue, total lines sold).

Data Loading: Loaded the transformed data into Power BI for seamless analysis and visualization.

Data Modeling
Defining Relationships: Established relationships between tables (sales, customers, products) to maintain data integrity and support efficient querying.

Creating Measures and Calculations: Developed measures for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, units per order, and unique customers.

Building Hierarchies: Created hierarchies to enable drill-down analysis at various levels (e.g., region, category, and time period).

Visualization and Reporting
Interactive Dashboards: Designed visually appealing Power BI dashboards to present key metrics such as total quantity (85,533), return quantity (1,828), total revenue (28,221K), and top customer by order quantity (Abby Rana).

Category Distribution: Showcased total quantity by product category (Clothing: 14.54%, Bikes: 17.87%, Accessories: 67.59%) and individual product performance using treemaps.

Subcategory Performance: Provided detailed insights into subcategories like "Tires and Tubes" and "Bottles and Cages" with total quantity, total revenue, and total lines.

Geographic Insights: Visualized sales distribution by continent and country using world maps and bar charts, highlighting top regions such as the United States and Australia.

Quarterly Trends: Illustrated sales trends from Q1 2015 to Q4 2017, revealing seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.

Key Points of Interest
Total Quantity and Revenue: Quick performance assessments with comprehensive metrics.

Regional Performance: Pie chart visualization showing revenue distribution by region, with Australia leading.

Product Categories: Bar charts highlighting revenue and quantity by category.

Trends Analysis: Quarterly trends illustrating sales patterns and aiding inventory planning.

Customer Metrics: Insights into unique customers (18,148) and units per order (1.53).

Top Customer & Product Insights: Detailed product performance and top customer data.

Interactive Filtering: Dynamic filtering by region and time period for deeper data exploration.

Conclusion
This Adventure Works Cycle Sales Performance Dashboard exemplifies the power of data analytics in driving business insights and strategic decision-making. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to handling data, from extraction to insightful visualizations, making it a valuable tool for understanding and optimizing sales performance.
